# Code Writing Standards

## 1. The code organization must be clean and orderly

- Group related functionality together
- Maintain clear file and directory structure
- Separate concerns appropriately (UI, logic, data, utilities)
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility

## 2. Code logic and naming must be intuitive

- Write code that reads like natural language
- Use descriptive names that clearly express intent
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Follow consistent patterns throughout the codebase

### 2.1 Naming Principles

- **Clarity over brevity**: `currentSelectedObjectId` is better than `objId`
- **Action verbs for functions**: `calculateTotal`, `renderCanvas`, `updateState`
- **Boolean prefixes**: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit`
- **Descriptive nouns**: `drawingTool`, `canvasElement`, `pluginRegistry`

## 3. Adhere to core principles while avoiding over-engineering, with readability as the top priority

- Keep solutions simple and straightforward
- Avoid premature optimization or abstraction
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability
- Don't add complexity unless it solves a real problem
- Refactor when patterns emerge naturally, not preemptively

## 4. Naming Consistency

### 4.1 Related Methods Should Use Consistent Naming Patterns

When methods represent different stages of the same process or lifecycle, they should follow a unified naming convention:

**Good Examples:**

- `startDrawing`, `updateDrawing`, `finishDrawing` - Unified verb-based naming for drawing lifecycle
- `onActivate`, `onDeactivate` - Unified `on` prefix for lifecycle hooks
- `handleTap`, `handleDrag` - Unified `handle` prefix for event handlers

**Bad Examples:**

- `handleMouseDown`, `updateDrawing`, `finishDrawing` - Mixed prefixes (`handle` vs verb-based)
- `onActivate`, `handleDeactivate` - Mixed prefixes (`on` vs `handle`)

### 4.2 Lifecycle Methods

Methods that represent lifecycle stages should use consistent naming:

- Use verb-based names for sequential operations: `start`, `update`, `finish`
- Use `on` prefix for event-driven lifecycle hooks: `onActivate`, `onDeactivate`
- Use `handle` prefix for event handlers: `handleTap`, `handleDrag`

### 4.3 Avoid Mixing Naming Conventions

Do not mix different naming conventions within the same interface or related functionality. Choose one pattern and stick to it consistently.
